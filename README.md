### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to answer the questions that keep me up at night with the tools I know already exist, specifically starting with git, gitHub, python, SQL, and whatever else comes up between me and fiddling with data. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on finding discernable patterns in what materials and methods Purple Martins use in building their nests and if there's an effect on the survival of the young. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... uhm, honestly, I could just use some encouragement. I am faced with a complete change in how I live my life day to day, and it's not completely voluntary. I'm just trying to steer the ship, and I think that choosing what skills to give my time to developing is about the best I can do right now. Wading through and keeping my metaphorical knees high.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about birds. Or the FreeGardeners if you're really into that liminal space between confusion and inspiration.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm u/SerotoninSkunk on reddit and here, and I'm sure I exist elsewhere on the internet. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I prefer people use my name, although there are many names that will do, Sero, Toni, Skunk, others work too if you want to ask for other options. If things like "Sero is doing it Seroself" don't fit in your mouth under your fingers very well, then please feel free to use whatever pronouns reflect your interactions with me. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Dill pickles are green!
